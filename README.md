In this project, we have determined water potability based on various other features such as ph, hardness,amount of solids, sulfate, chloramines and few others. We have tried to solve this water potability problem using Machine Learning classification models. <br>

Dataset used: From Kaggle <br>

The main task in this projecct was to deal with imbalance dataset and compare different classification models for unbalanced as well as oversampled and balanced dataset.
